	Holi (Hindi pronunciation: ['hoÀêli:]) is a popular and significant Hindu festival celebrated as the Festival of Colours, Love, and Spring.[1][6][7][8] It celebrates the eternal and divine love of the deities Radha and Krishna.[9][10] Additionally, the day signifies the triumph of good over evil,[11][12] as it commemorates the victory of Vishnu as Narasimha over Hiranyakashipu.[13][14] Holi originated and is predominantly celebrated in the Indian subcontinent, but has also spread to other regions of Asia and parts of the Western world through the Indian diaspora.[7][15][16][17][18][19][20][21]

Holi also celebrates the arrival of Spring in India, the end of winter, and the blossoming of love.[15][22] It is also an invocation for a good spring harvest season.[15][22] It lasts for a night and a day, starting on the evening of the Purnima (full moon day) falling on the Hindu calendar month of Phalguna, which falls around the middle of March in the Gregorian calendar.
